# supermemo_web_import
 AutoHotkey script for quick import from browser to SuperMemo.

Select text and press `ctrl+shift+alt+A` in the browser (currently supporting Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge) to import to SuperMemo.

May not work well or take longer time when the text is too long.

Features:

- format cleaned
- references included (title, source, link)

To Do:

- check duplicates (for now, copying the link and doing ctrl+F search in SuperMemo seem to be the easiest way of checking duplicates)
